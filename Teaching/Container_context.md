# Container library and Context Manager in Python

## Background

### Context managers :

In any programming language,resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if user have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources in Python, it can be achieved by the you.Inorder to make our lives easy and the code space optimized ,context managers are introduced.

### Container library :

Python programming language has four collection data types- list, tuple, sets and dictionary. But python also comes with a built-in module known as collections which has specialized data structures which basically covers for the shortcomings of the four data types and reduces your number of lines of extra code.

## What do you need to do

The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts.

- Implementations of Context Managers and its Merits
- What are Collection libraries and its examples
- Task to be demonstarted using the implementations of context managers and collection libraries

The dataset for the task is avaviable at : <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14tX5rQQBlYVU1xeRcy8creUtT86TupV9?usp=sharing>
