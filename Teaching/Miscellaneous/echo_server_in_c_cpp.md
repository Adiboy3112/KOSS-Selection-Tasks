# To Do

Teach the audience on how to create a basic echo server (a server that sends back the msessage it receives) in C/C++ using any appropriate library. This is not a coding task, you have to just explain the theory on creating a web server ( you must include code snippets to be explained ).

# What to Do

- Create a presentation about your journey to create the server
- Research how these APIs are used - any 3 out of : _poll()_,_select()_,_fork()_,_threads_,etc.) - for creating concurrent servers
- Compare these methods
