# Race Conditions and Deadlocks

## Background

[Race Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) is a common condition in which one dat ais dependent on some other process's response. The same happens in case of database entries. This condition is highly probable to occur such as booking of two tickets for same movie seat. Hence it is very necessary to handle this condition. Deadlocks and concurrency control methods are used to handle inserts and reads in such transactions.

## What you need to do

<div align="justify">
The candidate needs to make a small presentation of around 8-10 mins (do not exceed 10min) and give the lecture in the next interview to us. The topics that are to be covered are listed below. The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below.
</div>

- Start with a very basic description of SQL and its ACID Properties [1]

- Talk about different types of locks (Exclusive,Shared,Update) [2]

- Can Speak about concurrency control methods in DBMS like 2PL,T/O (no need to go to depth,a basic overview would be good enough) [3]

- Briefly explain about race conditon and how to handle them (preferably with a example).

<div align="justify">
Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. A long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired of presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.

## Tech Stack

<div align="justify">
Basic SQL is good enough for performing this task. If you worked in some real database like MySQL,PostgreSQL you will be able to relate the things very well.

## Learning from the task

- Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is how to google. Obviously, not all people are acquainted with all the technical stuff and during the making of the presentation, the interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that Google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

- This task is not for someone who has done a formal course in DBMS or has it sometime in academics. People who just started working in SQL are best for this task. One can relate the real problems while designing a database through this task.
