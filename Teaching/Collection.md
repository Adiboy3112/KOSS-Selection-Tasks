# Collection library and Context Manager in Python

## Background

### Context managers :

In any programming language, resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if user have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources in Python, it can be achieved by the you. In-order to make our lives easy and the code space optimized ,context managers are introduced.

### Container library :

Python programming language has four collection datatypes- list, tuple, sets and dictionary. But python also comes with a built-in module known as collections which has specialized data structures which basically covers for the shortcomings of the four data types and reduces your number of lines of extra code.

## What do you need to do

The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts.

- Implementations of Context Managers and its Merits.
- Introduction to collection libraries and container datatypes.
- How are the contatiner datatypes within the collection modules different from the Python's built-in containers.
- Task to be demonstarted using the implementations of context managers and collection libraries.

Pease remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. **(Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.**

### Task Details

- **Part I**:Given below is the link to a colab file which contains a list of words for which you need to calculate the count for each word present in the list, using the collections library.
  With the help of context managers print the output of the code in a txt file.
- **Part II** -Once you have generated the word count, you need to find the count of any word X let say,"happy" ,which may or may not be present in the generated dict.If the word is present, then print the word count else print "Not Present".

## Tech Stack

Prior knowledge of basic python programming is required in order to perform the task

## Learning from the Task

- Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is to how to google. Obviously not all person are acquainted with all the technical stuffs and during the making of the presentation, interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

- An in depth comparative study will improve our decision making skills and trying to defend the position as to why contaxt managers and container libraries is beneficial in the domains that you support will also give you in depth knowledge.

- Finally if you are new to programming domain, you get a head start on one of the simplest and easy to learn programming languages (namely Python).
