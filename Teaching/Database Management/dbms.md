# Essentials of Database Management System

## Background

<div align="justify">
Database Management is one of the essential topics of computer science which software engineer must because
they have to design database often. While designing a database it is important to choose the right database and design the database initially considering your projectâ€™s requirements otherwise later one may have to again change the structure which is another headache.

## What you need to do

<div align="justify">
The candidate needs to make a small presentation of around 8-10 mins (do not exceed 10min) and give the lecture in the next interview to us. The topics that are to be covered are listed below. The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below.
</div>

* Start by a very brief introduction of DBMS, why it is used rather than the file system. Give a comparative study on Relational and NoSQL, advantages, and disadvantages of both.

* Provide a detailed description of different kinds of keys of the database, different types of relationships, and ER Diagram. Cover referential integrity. Show some examples of databases through ER Diagram like library database/college database. Cover weak entity set and total relationship set.

* Give a detailed talk on different normal forms, needs of each NF with examples.

* Include different queries in SQL starting from basic query to conditions, where clause, avg, sum, wildcards, joins, group by, etc.

* In case you are not able to include all the topics within 10 minutes feel free to cover whatever topic you are able to cover. Make sure you understand everything that you present.
<div align="justify">
Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. A long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired of presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.

* [Database course NPTEL](http://www.infocobuild.com/education/audio-video-courses/computer-science/database-management-system-iit-kharagpur.html)
* [Geeksforgeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/)

## Tech Stack

<div align="justify">
No coding experience is required. If you worked in some real database like MySQL / MongoDB you will be able to relate the things very well. But without that also one should be able to do it.
</div>

## Learning from the task
* Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is how to google. Obviously, not all people are acquainted with all the technical stuff and during the making of the presentation, the interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that Google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

* This task is not for someone who has done a formal course in DBMS or has it sometime in academics. People who just started working in SQL are best for this task. One can relate the real problems while designing a database through this task.

* Proper explanation skills can also be judged by this task as this is not a coding presentation, the topics can be explained clearly with the help of diagrams and tables.
