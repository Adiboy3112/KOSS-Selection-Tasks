# Functional Programming (Features and comparative study)

## Background

<div align="justify">
In the fast growing world of Object Oriented programming, people are often forgetting a very important paradigm of programming known as he functional programming paradigm (often shortened as FP).In todays world, there are many domains where he functional programming languages will be working at par or even better than Object Oriented Programming (depending on the use cases). Moreover based on functional programming paradigm algorithms can be improvised for tasks like garbage collection.

## What you need to do

<div align="justify">
The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts.
</div>

* Give an introduction to paradigms of programming keeping in focus functional programming and its distinguishing features that make it very special. For example the following points can be elaborated on FP by point out the What, Why and How's. 
	* **Statically typed**
	* What it means to be **Purely functional**
	* **Type inferencing** in FP
	* Languages inn FP being **Lazy** and **Concurrent**.
	* How **Lambdas** are essential part.

* Make a comparative study by comparing he merits and demerits of the domains of Functional programing and Object Oriented Programming. Argue on the different features with supporting examples to make your point (Can include code snippets as examples)

* Using the above argumentations build on the scenarios or Use Cases when the Functional programming will be more beneficial than Object oriented programming. Justify why there is a trend that now object oriented programming languages like C++ and python have introduced functional programming paradigm features in their languages in the form of Lambda functions (There is subtle shift in trends).

* Give some insight as to how the features above are actually implemented in real life and what are the advancement brought about in these languages over the years. It is suggested that you se Haskell for his demonstration purpose as the documentation is very elaborate and the language has gained man features over the past few years. How ever you can also use OOP languages to demonstrate the same, the decision is left upon the interviewee.

<div align="justify">
Pease remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also  get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.

## Tech Stack

<div align="justify">
For his task no prior knowledge of an programming is also fine since the interviewee will be majorly making a comparative study into the domain of paradigms of programming. However prior knowledge in some programming language might give you a head start as to understanding what is happening behind he scenes in languages like Haskell.
</div>

## Learning from the task
* Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is to how to google. Obviously not all person are acquainted with all the technical stuffs and during the making of the presentation, interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

* For this task we are expecting that the interviewee doesn't have experience in programming (basic task), hence during the task the interviewee will be learning about the two major paradigms of programming (namely OOP and FP). he interviewee will also gain some basic knowledge as to when he application of each paradigm is more helpful

* An in depth comparative study will improve our decision making skills and trying to defend the position as to why functional programming is beneficial in the domains that you support will also give you in depth knowledge of he benefits and the vastly unexplored potentials of functional programming.

* Finally if you are new to programming domain,  you get a head start on one of the simplest and easy to learn programming languages (namely Haskell).
