# Async Await Promises and Callbacks in Javascript

## Background:

Suppose you are a hotel manager and you wish to hire a waiter. In order to judge their abilities you ask them to demonstrate their skills.What the first waiter does is that, if a customer has placed an order, the waiter goes to the chef with the order and waits for an entire hour until the dish has been prepared and only after serving the dish does he take the next order form another customer.On the other hand the second waiter takes the order delivers it to the cook and goes on to take the next order from the customer and serves the dish when it is prepared. Whom would you like to hire ? Definately not the first one right?

The same thing might happen to your code if the user wishes to fetch something and the other processes are at a halt.This is where you need to know about the concept of synchronous and asynchronous programming.

## What do you need to do:

The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts:

- Synchronous Vs Asynchronous
- How to make an asynchronous code
- Why are Promises better than Callbacks describing each thoroughly
- Use of async/await over Promises
- Provide relevant code snippets wherever possible
- It would be better if you associate topics with a real life example.

**Pease remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.**

## Tech Stack:

Prior knowledge of basic javascript is required to do this task.However newbies having basic programming knowledge can also be alloted.

## Learning from the Task:

- Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is to how to google. Obviously not all person are acquainted with all the technical stuffs and during the making of the presentation, interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

- An in depth comparative study will improve our decision making skills and trying to defend the position as to why asynchronous is beneficial in the domains that you support will also give you in depth knowledge.

- Finally if you are new to programming domain, you get a head start on one of the simplest and easy to learn programming languages (namely Javascript).
