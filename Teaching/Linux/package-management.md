# Package Management on Linux!

## Background
One of the best features in Linux distributions is the great in-built package management tools, such as `apt`, `pacman` and `yum`. One of the major differences between various Linux distributions is package management. Many times, this is the reason somebody steers away from one distribution to another, because he/she doesn't like the way software is installed or because there is software needed that isn't available in the distro's repositories. We would like you to explore various package management tools, from a distro of your choice (`apt` if using Debian and variants, `pacman` if on Arch and derivates), and explain briefly how a package manager works

## What do you need to do

You would need to do the following. This is a non-exhaustive list, and we'd like you to explore, and add more ideas to this list:
- Find out the different tools that are used for managing packages on different distributions
- Pick one of them, and find out some more about the internals - How it manage repositories, how it distribute manifest files (Ex PKGBUILD for pacman)
- Show us some examples of the above - If using pacman, show and explain a simple PKGBUILD file, or if using apt, show us how you could add a repository
- (Optional) Write a simple application, using C or Python, and try writing a `PKGBUILD` file, if you're using pacman on Arch and derivates, or package into a `.deb` file if using a Debian based distro

We know that this task involves learning about a lot of concepts, so we do not except you to become masters in just a couple of days. We want to see what you've explored, and the effort you've put into the presentation 


Please create a presentation, either using PPT, or using a tool such as Reveal.JS. The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all. Keep it short, to less than 20 slides or so, and you could include images, screenshots from commands run, and short snippets of code, to keep the audience interested
