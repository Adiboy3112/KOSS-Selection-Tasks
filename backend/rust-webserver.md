# Writing a simple Web Server with Rust!

Write a web server that:
- Listens on a specified port (5000/8000)
- Has a single endpoint, that serves 1 HTML file, along with CSS and a JS script. 

Explain all the crates you have used, and write a detailed README with build/run instructions. 

(Optional) Tell us how you could deploy this application using Docker. This is purely an optional component, and you could feel free to ignore
