# Data Scraping

## Story
Data scraping is a useful task in software engineering. It is also useful in preparing data-sets for the machine learning models and other research stuff. We at KOSS require lot of data processing, so data scraping is an integral part.

## Materials
* Nothing as such :P

## What you need to do
* You need to scrape weather data from the internet. The user can input his location (If that is a City) or latitude/longitude coordinates and based on that you can display the following response - 
	* Description of the weather
	* Min / Max temperature
	* Humidity
	* Timezone

* You have to create a command line interface **CLI**  which would accept the data from the user and accept the following option for displaying the meta-data for the above.
* You need to document your approach in a `.md` file explaining your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting. 
* _Bonus task 1_ - Instead of taking input from the user about the location, automatically recognise the location.
* _Bonus task 2_ - You can do the same using an API service. 


## Tech-Stack
* You can use any programming language and tools that are available, however make sure that you are ready to explain why you chose that and the pros / cons that you encountered while using that.

## Learning from the task

While you must have some experience with programming while doing this task, we know beforehand that this task would be difficult for people who don't have much experience with back-end. 
So, you are encouraged to google the technical stuff that you have encountered out here, use technical blogs to understand and practically implement it.
Note that, don't get lost in the theoretical sea, there are infinite topics in back-end which are impossible to know, so you should use the rule of thumb to judiciously use your time to maintain a balance of theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
